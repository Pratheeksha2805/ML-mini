Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition
This project aims to classify images of various fruits and vegetables using a deep learning model built with the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model leverages transfer learning for efficient 
image processing and provides accurate predictions along with calorie information.
Project Overview
This project develops a deep learning-based image classification model capable of identifying different fruits and vegetables. The model also provides nutritional information (calories) based on the identified fruit or vegetable, aiding users in making healthier choices.

Key Features
Image Classification: Classifies images of fruits and vegetables with high accuracy.
Transfer Learning: Uses MobileNetV2 for fast and efficient training.
Calorie Prediction: Provides calorie information for the identified item.
User Interface: Built with Streamlit to allow users to upload images and get predictions in real-time.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
MobileNetV2
Streamlit (for the user interface)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
The dataset used contains images of various fruits and vegetables, organized into training, validation, and test sets. Each image belongs to a specific category, with labels provided accordingly.
